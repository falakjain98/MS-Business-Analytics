    "\n",
    "This question asks you to create a tool to perform simple accounting for stock trading. Write a function called \"accounting\" with two input arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- prices: a list of positive numbers corresponding to the price of a stock in successive days. \n",
    "- changes: a list of integers (positive or negative) corresponding to the change in the number of shares carried. A positive number corresponds to buying shares of the stock and a negative number corresponds to selling. It is possible for you to own net negative shares of the stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may assume that the two lists are of the same length. The function should return (not print) the following two numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- net change in shares: the sum of the numbers in the list \"changes\".\n",
    "- net change in cash: the net money spent or earned over the trades in the list \"changes\". Buying the stock costs money and selling it earns money. \n",

    "## Q3. Grocery Store Restocking\n",
    "\n",
    "This question asks you to make a tool that helps a grocery store to analyze their policy for restocking shelves for a certain non-perishable item. Write a function called `analyzeScenario` with three input parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `demandList`: a non-empty list of non-negative integers representing the forecasted daily demand for the item, corresponding to a period of consecutive days. The number of days is `len(demandList)`.\n",
    "- `stockingLevel`: a positive integer representing the maximum number of units that the store will stock on its shelves at any time.\n",
    "- `minimumLevel`: a non-negative integer representing the minimum number of units on the shelves that the store can tolerate without restocking. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the store makes its stocking decision at the end of each day after closing. If the leftover inventory on the shelf at the end of a day is strictly below the \"minimumLevel\", then the store will restock to a full shelf, and the inventory at the beginning of the next day will be equal to \"stockingLevel\". If the leftover inventory at the end of a day is greater than or equal to \"minimumLevel\", then the store will not add anything to the shelf, and the inventory at the beginning of the next day will be the same as the leftover inventory. On the first day, the shelf is full, so the inventory level is equal to \"stockingLevel\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should print (not return) the number of times it would decide to restock during the period represented by the input data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the sample run\n",

    "```\n",
    "The following table illustrates the inventory dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Beginning Inventory | Demand |   Leftover Inventory | Restock? |\n",
    "|--|--|--|--|\n",
    "|10|3 |7 |No |\n",
    "|7 |4 |3 |No |\n",
    "|3 |2 |1 | Yes |\n",
    "|10|5 |5 | No |\n",

    "|**# of times to restock:**|` `|` `| **4**|\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if demand is greater than the beginning inventory, the leftover inventory is zero. Otherwise, the leftover inventory is equal to the beginning inventory minus the demand.
