    "## Q1. Exercise Selection in Course Design (Concrete Formulation; 10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor Shi would like to select an optimal set of exercises for his course, so that students learn a lot from doing the exercises and the level of difficulty builds up gradually. He has in mind a fixed set of exercises to select from. For each exercise, he has assigned a difficulty score out of 10, and a learning score out of 10. A higher difficulty score means that the exercise is more difficult, and a higher learning score means that it has higher potential to teach the students useful skills for the real world. As an example, the following table lists a set of 11 exercises to select from, along with their assigned scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Exercise \\#| Difficulty Score | Learning Score |\n",
    "|--|--|--|\n",
    "|0|0|-|\n",
    "|1|1|2|\n",
    "|2|2|3|\n",
    "|3|3|4|\n",
    "|4|3|6|\n",
    "|5|4|7|\n",
    "|6|5|8|\n",
    "|7|6|7|\n",
    "|8|7|8|\n",
    "|9|9|9|\n",
    "|10|10|-|\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above, Exercise 0 is the easiest and corresponds to an introductory exercise that sets the baseline for the course, and Exercise 10 is the hardest and represents the final exam. Both of these must always be included in the course, so their learning scores are not relevant for the optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write a concrete formulation of a linear optimization model to decide which of the exercises 1 through 9 to select in order to maximize the total learning score of the selected exercises, subject to the following constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Among Exercises 1 through 9, at most four can be selected due to time limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In order to ensure that there is no big jump in difficulty between two consecutive exercises that are selected, the maximum gap in difficulty score between two consecutive selected exercises is at most 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, if the set of all selected exercises is $\\{0, 1, 5, 7, 9, 10\\}$, then this would satisfy this constraint, as the gap in difficulty score between the pair of consecutive exercises $(0,1)$ is 1, between the pair $(1,5)$ is 3, between the pair $(5,7)$ is 2, between the pair $(7,9)$ is 3, and between the pair $(9,10)$ is 1. \n",
    "- However, if the set of all selected exercises is $\\{0,1,6,7,9,10\\}$, then this constraint would be violated as the difficulty gap between the pair $(1,6)$ is $4$. Similarly, $\\{0,1,3,5,7,10\\}$ would violate this constraint, as the difficulty gap between the pair $(7,10)$ is 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Due to overlapping content, certain pairs of exercises should not be both selected. In this example, Exercises 2 and 8 should not be both selected. Moreover, Exercises 4 and 9 should not be both selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your constraints must allow for every feasible selection of exercises according to the above rules, and must disallow every infeasible selection. In other words, do not base the logic of your constraints on the numerical values of the learning scores given above."

The set of well-protected intersections is $\\{A,B,E,F\\}$. The total protection score is 6+4=10. (By definition, every well-protected intersection is also protected, so a well-protected intersection effectively has a weight of 2 in the total protection score, whereas a protected intersection that is not well-protected has a weight of 1.)\n",
