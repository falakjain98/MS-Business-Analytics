    "## Exercise 11.3: Assigning Consultants to Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "Trojan Consulting would like to assign consultants to projects in a way that minimizes total travel costs while satisfying the skill requirements of each project and avoiding assigning the same consultant to two projects with overlapping time frames. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, there are four consultants, each of whom may possess one or more of two possible skills. (A checkmark indicates whether the person has the skill.) Each project requires at least a certain number of consultants of each skill. If a consultant has both skills, he/she can count toward the number required for both skills, and the travel cost may potentially be less as one less person would be needed. Projects 1 and 2 have conflicting timelines, so the same consultant cannot be assigned to both. Similarly, projects 2 and 3 are also in conflict. But the same consultant may be assigned to projects 1 and 3.\n",
