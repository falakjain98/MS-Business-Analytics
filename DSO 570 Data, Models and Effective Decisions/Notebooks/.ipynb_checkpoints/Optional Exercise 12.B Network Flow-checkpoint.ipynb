    "## Optional Exercise 12.B Network Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "This question asks you to implement an abstract formulation for Exercise 9.2: A company manufactures a type of heavy machinery in city 0 and would like to determine the fastest rate at which it can deliver machines to customers in city $n$. (Rate, or throughput, is measured in the average number of machines delivered per day.) The bottleneck is that the company must use a special type of truck to ship the machine, and a limited number of these trucks travel each day from one city to an adjacent one. Each truck can carry only one machine at a time. The number of trucks going between each pair of city is given and cannot be controlled by the company. The following is an abstract formulation that solves this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Variables:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- $n$: the number of cities excluding the source, City 0. \n",
    "- $C$: the set of cities. $C=\\{0,1,\\cdots, n\\}$.\n",
    "- $q_{i,j}$: the number of trucks traveling from city $i \\in C$ to city $j \\in C$ each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_{i,j}$: the rate of shipping from city $i \\in C$ to city $j \\in C$. (Continuous)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective and Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\text{Maximize: } && \\sum_{i \\in C} x_{i,n} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{s.t.} && \\\\\n",
    "\\text{(In-flow = Out-flow)} && \\sum_{j\\in C}  x_{i,j} &= \\sum_{j\\in C}  x_{j,i} && \\text{For each intermediate city $i \\in \\{1,2,\\cdots, n-1\\}$.} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{(No out-flow from destination)} && x_{n,i} & = 0 && \\text{For each city $i \\in C$.} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{(Truck capacity)} && x_{i,j} & \\le q_{i,j} && \\text{For all $i,j \\in C$.} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{(Non-negativity)} && x_{i,j} & \\ge 0 && \\text{For all $i, j \\in C$.}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write a function called \"optimize\" with two input parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **inputFile**: filename of a CSV file providing the data on the truck capacities. The format is exactly as in the attached file \"12-network-input.csv\". This table lists the $q_{i,j}$ for each pair of origin and destination cities with positive truck capacity. (Capacity $q_{i,j}$ is defined as the number of trucks traveling each day from $i$ to $j$, which the company can use if needed.) For any pair $(i,j)$ that does not exist in this table, you should assume that the capacity $q_{i,j}=0$. You can infer the value of $n$ from the maximum value of the column \"Destination\". You can assume that all values in the columns \"Origin\" and \"Destination\" are among the set $\\{0,1,\\cdots, n\\}$.\n",
    "- **outputFile**: the name of an Excel file to which you will write the results of the optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your function should write two sheets to the outputFile, the first giving the optimal objective value, and the second giving the optimal values of $x_{i,j}$'s (only positive values should be listed in the output).** The format of the outputFile must exactly match the sample output file \"12-network-output.xlsx\" attached, although the order of displaying the $x_{i,j}$'s does not need to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write your function in the code cell below. The cell must import all packages needed and contain all your code, so that if someone restarts the Jupyter notebook kernel and only runs the following cell, then the test code below will work.**"
