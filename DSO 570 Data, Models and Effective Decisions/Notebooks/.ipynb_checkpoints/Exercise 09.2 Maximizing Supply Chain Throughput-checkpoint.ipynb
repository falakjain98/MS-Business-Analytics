    "A company manufactures a type of heavy machinery in city A and would like to determine the fastest rate at which it can deliver machines to customers in city D. (Rate, or throughput, is measured in the average number of machines delivered per day.) The bottleneck is that the company must use a special type of truck to ship the machine, and a limited number of these trucks travel between two adjacent cities each day. Each truck can carry only one machine at a time, and each truck only makes trips between two specified cities and will not go anywhere else. The following figure shows which cities are adjacent and how many trucks travel between each pair of adjacent cities in either directions each day.\n",

    "For example, 8 trucks travel from A to B per day, and all 8 return from B to A on the same day. Since a truck can bear load when travelling in either directions, the rate at which machines travel between A and B is at most 8 per day in either directions. Machines that arrive at city B must be immediately unloaded from the truck it came from (as the truck is going back to city A); later on, that machine can be loaded unto other trucks that travel for example to city C or D. Because all the demand are in city D, the rate at which machines arrive into city B must equal the rate at which machines leave city B, and similarly for city C. \n",
