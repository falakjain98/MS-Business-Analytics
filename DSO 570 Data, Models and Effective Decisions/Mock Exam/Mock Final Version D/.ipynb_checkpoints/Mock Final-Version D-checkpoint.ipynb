    "# Q1. Airport Transportation Service (Concrete Formulation; 10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pedro owns a family business providing rides to and from the airport. His primary vehicle is a large van, which he operates himself. He owns a second vehicle, a small sedan, which is operated by his wife. Ride requests that are not fulfilled by him or his wife are passed on to his network of business partners. He has many business partners and you can assume that he can find available business partners to pick up every customer if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pedro would like to compute an optimal plan for fulfilling ride requests so as to maximize the total profit earned by him and his wife. (His business does not profit from requests passed on to his business partners.) The following table summarizes the ride requests his business received for a given morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Customer | Van Needed | Pickup Time | Pickup Location | Dropoff Location | Profit (dollars) |\n",

    "| Edna | No | 11:30 | Downtown | Airport | 30 |\n",
    "| Frank | No | 12:00 | Suburb | Airport | 55\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the travel times (in minutes) between each pair of locations. You can assume that these estimates are conservative, so that regardless of traffic conditions, one can always travel between any spot in the Airport and any spot in Downtown within 30 minutes, and between any spot in the Airport and any spot in the Surburb within 45 minutes, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Origin\\Destination | Airport | Downtown | Suburb |\n",

    "| Suburb | 45 | 30 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each customer is only requesting one car, so if Pedro picks up a customer, then his wife can be simultaneously fulfilling another request. Moreover, a ride needs to be completed before the same driver can pickup another customer. A plan for fulfilling ride requests also needs to satisfy the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A request with a \"Yes\" in the \"Van Needed\" column can be assigned to Pedro, but it cannot be assigned to his wife. \n",
    "- Each assigned driver needs to be able to arrive on time to each pickup location, based on the travel times above. For example, the same driver cannot pickup both Anne and Beth, because if the driver departs from the Suburb at 09:00, he/she would drop off Anne at the Airport at 09:45. If the driver immediately proceed to pick up Beth, he/she would arrive at Downtown at 10:15, which is later than the 10:00 pickup time requested by Beth. On the other hand, the same driver can pick up both Beth and Cui, because if the driver pickups Beth at Downtown at 10:00, he/she would drop her off at the airport at exactly 10:30, which is the perfect time to pickup Cui. You should examine the tables above to infer all such scheduling constraints. When doing so, you just have to make sure that after dropping off the previous customer, the driver can arrive on time at the next pickup location assigned to him or her, according to the driving time estimates. Moreover, you should not plan for extra margins: the driving times can be thought of as already incorporating everything needed for a trip, such as finding the passenger within the given location, loading or unloading luggage, and collecting payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final consideration is as follows: that morning, his wife has other things she would like to attend to, so there is a large opportunity cost on her time. Pedro estimates that having his wife drive that morning is equivalent to incurring a fixed cost of 90 dollars, whereas if he does not assign any rides to her, he can save this cost. **This cost needs to be accounted for in the total profit being maximized.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a linear optimization formulation for the above problem. You only need to write a concrete formulation, so you don't need any data variables but can simply plug in the numbers above. However, you cannot just solve the problem by hand and write down the optimal solution. In particular, if the \"Profit (dollars)\" column changes to other numbers, then one should be able to simply update the corresponding numbers in your formulation, and it should still be correct. "

    "# Q2. Pooling in Ride-Hailing (Abstract Formulation; 10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem asks you to write a linear optimization formulation to solve a simplified version of the pooling problem faced by ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Lyft. These companies provide discounts to riders who are willing to let their trips be \"pooled\" with another trip, so that a driver would pick up both riders before dropping off each of them at their respective destinations. Through pooling, the travel time of each rider would increase, but driver capacity is more efficiently utilized. This practice is only profitable if the company finds good matches between trips so as to maximize the total benefit of pooling. \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, assume that each trip can be pooled with at most one other trip. The ride-hailing company has estimated the benefit of pooling for each pair of trips, which accounts for the potential cost savings from pooling and the potential inconveniences incurred for the pooled customers. As an illustration, suppose there are six trips, labelled A through F. The following table shows what the benefit values may look like.\n",

    "| F | 1 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the table is symmetric, which means that it remains the same if it is transposed. In other words, pooling A-B is the same as pooling B-A; their order does not matter. As an illustration of how to use the table, suppose that trips B and C are pooled together, and trips E and F are pooled together, while trip A and trip D are not pooled; then the total benefit is $5+4=9$. As another example, suppose that trips A and B are pooled together, and none of the other trips are pooled; then the total benefit is $6$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ride-hailing company would like to pool trips so as to maximize the total benefit of pooled trips subject to the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each trip can be pooled with at most one other trip. (It is also possible for a trip to be not pooled, as in the examples above.)\n",
    "- For a pair of trips, if the benefit of pooling is strictly less than a threshold $t$, then the trips cannot be pooled. For example, if $t=3$, then the above table implies that A-D is a valid pooling, but B-E is not. \n",
    "- The total number of pooled pairs is at most $k$. In the above example, if $t=0$ and $k=3$, then the optimal solution is to pool A-C, B-D, and E-F, which yields a total benefit of $4+5+4=13$. However, if $t=0$ and $k=1$, then the optimal solution is to only pool A-B, which yields a benefit of $6$.\n",

    "Your abstract formulation needs to be able to correctly handle arbitrarily many trips, arbitrary benefits of pooling, and arbitrary values of $t$ and $k$. You may assume that the table is always symmetric as above, with zeros on the diagonal and non-negative entries everywhere else.
