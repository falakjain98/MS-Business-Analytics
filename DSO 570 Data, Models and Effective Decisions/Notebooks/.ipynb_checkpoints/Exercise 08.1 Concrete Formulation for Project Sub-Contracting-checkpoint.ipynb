    "Tom Burke, owner of Burke Construction, has promised to complete five projects this winter. Burke Construction has 10 workers that will work 40 hours a week for 12 weeks this winter. Since this is a limited workforce, Tom knows that he will not be able to complete all of his construction projects without subcontracting some of them. In the table below, he has estimated the amount of labor hours required by each project, and the profit to his company. (All profits are in thousands of dollars.)\n",
