    "**1. English description**: write a succinct verbal description of the decision, objective and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Concrete formulation**: translate the above into a linear optimization formulation, illustrating with made-up numbers from a toy example. \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Abstract formulation**: identify patterns in the above and rewrite the formulation into one that can be scaled up to arbitrary data, by defining data variables and using index and summation notations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Reusable software**: write Python code to take in any input data of a certain format and output the optimal decision.\n",
