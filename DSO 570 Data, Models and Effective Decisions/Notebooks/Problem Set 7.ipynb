Moreover, the schedules for the next two semesters have already been published, and this gives her information about scheduling conflicts as well as how much time she can afford to spend on these electives after accounting for her mandatory courses and other responsibilities. **Each course is a single semester long and can be taken only once, but the same course may be offered in both semesters, so she can choose when to take each course as well as whether to take it.** These information are summarized in the three tables below.\n",
