    "There are three possible scores you can get from submitting this assignment on time (submitting a blank file or one without any apparent effort does not count). Note that the rubric is designed to incentivize you to go for 100% mastery of the material, as the little details matter a lot in business analytics. \n",

    "## Q1. Production Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Adapted from DMD Exercise 7.2)** The Magnetron Company manufactures and markets microwave ovens. Currently, the company produces two models: full-size and compact. Production is limited by the amount of labor available in the general assembly and electronic assembly departments, as well as by the demand for each model. Each full-size oven requires 2 hours of general assembly and 2 hours of electronic assembly, whereas each compact oven requires 1 hour of general assembly and 3 hours of electronic assembly. In the current production period, there are 500 hours of general assembly labor available and 800 hours of electronic assembly labor available. \n",
    "\n",
    "In additional, the company estimates that it can sell at most 220 full-size ovens and 180 compact ovens in the current production period. The earnings contribution per oven is 120 dollars for a full-size oven and 130 dollars for a compact oven. The company would like to find an earnings-maximizing production plan for the current production period. \n",
